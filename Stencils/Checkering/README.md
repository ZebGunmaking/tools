## Checkering Stencils
Printable paper stencils for creating checkering patterns at specific Lines-Per-Inch (LPI) and Diamond Height-To-Width Ratios (2.5, 3, and 3.5).

Currently only 12 LPI is uploaded, which can be used to draw out patterns for 24 LPI checkering. More sizes will be coming soon that will support other common LPI.

At the bottom right of each page you will see a description of the current stencil. Source files are included in this directory, so if you want to remove the branding have at it.

**WARNING**: When printing, make sure you don't scale the page in any way as that will change the measurements.
